; this file when run will spit out an HTML file with documentation on BearLang
; it doubles as a nice demo of the language

; to run it, simply do "bli gen_docs.bl >documentation.html" from inside the docs directory

(include "./inc/html_tools.bl")

(= doc_title "BearLang documentation")

(= doc_contents (+ (document_header doc_title)
		   ""

Handle floats and bignum - dynamically choose type of number at runtime
Misc lisp primitives
Make builtin operators work with other data types (concat strings with + operator etc)
Custom operators - like functions, but params aren't evaluated, instead passed as a simple list
Macros - like custom operators, but return expressions to be evaluated at compile time
String input
Add error handling
Tail call optimisation
FFI / Interop
Standard lib + import path
Basic modules support
  Native code extension modules
     Dynamic lib with special symbols
  .bl modules
Compiler
  Emit LLVM IR or C
  Compile code down to extension modules
  Compile code down to executable native lib
  Compile code down to executable binary

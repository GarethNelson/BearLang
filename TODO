Fix all TODO comments in codebase
Replace mpc with a custom higher-performing parser
Add context/metadata to the AST
Ensure 0 compiler warnings
Make bl_ser_sexp return a string that can always be turned back into the original expression or a placeholder symbo
Add builtin symbols (nil/None, #t, #f, *VERSION* etc etc)
Ensure 100% code coverage of runtime lib
Test runtime lib with all possible error conditions for all params
Add context/traceback stuff to error type
Add throw/raise/catch (piggyback on top of error type)
Handle floats and bignum - dynamically choose type of number at runtime
Misc lisp primitives
Make builtin operators work with other data types (concat strings with + operator etc)
Custom operators - like functions, but params aren't evaluated, instead passed as a simple list
Macros - like custom operators, but return expressions to be evaluated at compile time
String input
Tail call optimisation
FFI / Interop
Standard lib + import path
Basic modules support
  Native code extension modules
     Dynamic lib with special symbols
  .bl modules
Compiler
  Emit LLVM IR or C
  Compile code down to extension modules
  Compile code down to executable native lib
  Compile code down to executable binary
